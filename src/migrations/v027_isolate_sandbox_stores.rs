//! Migration v027: move shared sandbox stores to the private v2 layout.
//!
//! A live legacy cohort remains readable until it stops. Stopped cohorts are
//! planned under a global transition lock, copied under a per-root cohort lock
//! so unrelated registry writes carry on, then synced, atomically published
//! under the transition lock again, and switched by their durable generation
//! field. Staging directories, the journal, and the legacy quarantine exist
//! only while that bounded transition is pending; the committed state keeps
//! only `sandbox-v2/<instance>`.
