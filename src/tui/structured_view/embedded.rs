//! Embedded (preview-pane) variant of the structured view.
//!
//! Unlike the full-screen loop in the parent module, this lives inside the home
//! screen's `App` loop, rendering into the preview pane while the session list
//! stays visible, the way live-send drives a terminal agent.
//!
//! [`EmbeddedView::next_event`] is the cancel-safe await the App's `select!`
//! races: it only awaits channel receives, so dropping the future loses nothing.
//! [`EmbeddedView::apply_event`] runs in the winning arm's body and may do HTTP
//! work (replay rehydration, queue drains, reconnect). Terminal input routes
//! through [`EmbeddedView::handle_event`], sharing the parent module's intent
//! dispatcher so keybindings cannot drift.
//!   cannot drift from the full-screen view.
