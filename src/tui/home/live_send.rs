//! Live-send mode: a "feels-attached" alternative to the compose dialog.
//!
//! `Tab` on a runnable session installs a `LiveSendState` and routes every key event
//! through this module's translator, which produces a `TmuxAction` for whichever
//! transport the pane has armed.
//!
//! While a VT channel carries input (`[tmux] vt_live`, tmux 3.8+, unix) the action is
//! encoded to raw terminal bytes and written into the pane socket, bypassing tmux's key
//! translation, so the encoder honors the pane's DECCKM itself. That is the default, and
//! a live input channel is a single-writer signal: two writers would interleave on one
//! pty input stream, so nothing goes through `send-keys` while it exists.
//!
//! Otherwise each action forks `tmux send-keys`: plain characters literally, every other
//! key by tmux key name with `C-` / `M-` prefixes. That covers tmux older than 3.8 (where
//! writing to a dead pane's input takes the server down), a pane whose forwarder never
//! connected, and `vt_live` turned off. A long-lived `tmux -C` connection was tried
//! (#1485) and EOF'd within milliseconds on macOS tmux 3.x, so one fork per coalesced
//! batch is the portable model; held keys and pastes coalesce into one fork.
//!
//! The user exits with one of the configured exit chords, a comma-separated list of chord
//! specs whose default is `C-q` alone: mobile-friendly, passes through restrictive SSH
//! clients, and leaves every other chord for the agent. A bound chord cannot be sent
//! through, so users who need `C-q` downstream configure a different exit.
//!
//! There is no echo, inline editing or review step; the preview pane is the only feedback,
//! and multi-line composition belongs in the compose dialog on `M`.
//!
//! Other reserved chords: `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` scroll the preview back
//! through agent history (bare `PageUp` / `PageDown` still passes through), and the mouse
//! wheel over the preview scrolls it through `handle_scroll_up` / `handle_scroll_down`.
