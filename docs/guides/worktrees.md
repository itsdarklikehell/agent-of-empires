# Worktrees Reference

A worktree session gets its own branch and checkout, created when the session is created and cleaned up when it is deleted.

## Creating one

```bash
aoe add . -w feat/my-feature -b                          # new branch off the repo default
aoe add . -w hotfix-1 -b --base-branch release-1.2       # new branch off a specific base
aoe add . -w feat/my-feature                             # attach: re-use or check out that branch
aoe worktree list                                        # every worktree
aoe worktree info <session>
aoe worktree cleanup                                     # find orphaned worktrees
aoe remove <session> [--delete-worktree]
```

`-b` is what switches between creating a branch and attaching to an existing one. `--base-branch` only matters with `-b`, and is resolved against the remotes first, then a local branch, so a teammate's not-yet-fetched branch works without a manual `git fetch`. Remote selection scores every configured remote, not just `origin`: in a fork plus `upstream` layout where `upstream/main` is ahead, aoe fetches and branches from there even when you typed `main`. Ties break toward `origin`. Without `--base-branch`, the branch starts from the repo's default.

In the TUI, enable the Worktree checkbox in the new-session dialog (`n`); the directory is derived from the session title. `Ctrl+P` on the Worktree field sets an explicit name, attaches to an existing branch, picks a base branch, or configures extra repos, and `Ctrl+P` on the Base field opens a branch picker over local and remote-tracking branches. The web wizard's **Worktree** row opens the same controls, with a base-branch typeahead and an **Attach to existing branch** toggle.

## Naming

A worktree session's title and its directory stay tied by default (`session.tie_workdir_to_name`), which applies only to aoe-managed worktree sessions:

- Renaming a session (TUI, web, `aoe session rename`, or `PATCH /api/sessions/{id}`) moves the directory to the title's path-safe slug before committing the title. A failed move leaves the title unchanged.
- The git branch is never renamed by default, since it may carry an upstream or an open PR. Opt in with the TUI rename dialog's "Also rename git branch", `--rename-branch`, or `rename_branch: true`. The TUI warns when the branch tracks a remote, because the remote branch and any open PR do not follow.
- A rename that would relocate the checkout or re-point its branch needs a stopped session and is refused while it runs. A title-only rename whose slug leaves the directory unchanged is allowed on a running session from the CLI and REST (the TUI still asks for a stopped session), and leaves a live structured-view worker alone.

Turn the setting off to relabel sessions freely while they run and to edit the directory name independently:

| Surface | How |
|---------|-----|
| CLI | `aoe session set-worktree-name <session> --name <new-name> [--rename-branch]` |
| TUI | Select the session and press `W`, or use the command palette |
| Web | Right-click the row, "Edit workdir name" |
| REST | `PATCH /api/sessions/{id}/worktree-name` with `{ "name", "rename_branch" }` |

Renaming moves the checkout with `git worktree move`, keeping its parent directory and swapping only the final component. It works only on aoe-managed worktrees of a stopped session; anything else is a validation error that changes nothing.

### When the directory moves outside aoe

aoe records a worktree's directory at creation, so relocating it from another shell leaves that record stale. aoe repairs it from `git worktree list`, matching on the session's branch, shortly after TUI startup, on a background sweep, at `aoe serve` startup, and on each CLI workdir edit. If exactly one live worktree checks out the branch, the path is rewritten; if two do, aoe leaves it alone rather than guessing. Reconciliation is point-in-time, so a directory moved while a process is already running stays stale until it restarts.

Two caveats: aoe locks the worktrees it creates, so an out-of-band `git worktree move` needs `git worktree unlock <path>` first, and a plain `mv` is not recoverable on its own, because git's record still names the old path. Run `git worktree repair <new-path>` and aoe will find it.

## Configuration

```toml
[worktree]
enabled = false
path_template = "../{repo-name}-worktrees/{branch}"
bare_repo_path_template = "./{branch}"
auto_cleanup = true
delete_branch_on_cleanup = false
init_submodules = true
```

Template variables are `{repo-name}` (repository folder name), `{branch}` (slashes become hyphens), and `{session-id}` (the first 8 characters of the session UUID), so `../wt/{branch}-{session-id}` or `./worktrees/{branch}` both work. Use `[session] row_tag = "branch"` to show branch tags in the TUI list.

### Bare repos

Bare repos are auto-detected and use `bare_repo_path_template` instead, so worktrees land as siblings inside the project directory. A sandboxed session needs this layout to reach the repo's git directory from the container.

### Submodules

After `git worktree add`, a checkout with a `.gitmodules` file gets `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Set `init_submodules = false` (or pass `--no-submodules`) for repos vendoring deep submodule trees, where every new session would otherwise sit in `Creating…` for minutes. On delete, aoe runs `git submodule deinit -f --all` first, so the `Force` checkbox is not needed just because a worktree has submodules; if git still refuses, aoe clears `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>/modules/` and prunes the stale entry itself.

## Cleanup

Deleting a session prompts to remove an aoe-managed worktree (or pass `--delete-worktree`); a manual worktree or a non-worktree session is left alone.

**Trashing relocates the worktree** into a sibling `.aoe-trash/<session-id>` holding directory with `git worktree move`, so trashed sessions stop cluttering the active checkouts while staying previewable. Restoring moves it back, and is refused if that path is now occupied. Purging removes it.

**The default branch's checkout is never removed.** In a bare-repo layout the default branch lives in a linked worktree other tooling expects to stay put, so aoe refuses to remove that checkout or delete its branch, reports the refusal, and deletes the session anyway. Force does not bypass this, including trash auto-purge and `aoe session empty-trash`, and `aoe worktree cleanup` lists such a checkout as skipped. Detection uses what git states: the bare repo's own `HEAD` plus every remote's `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`, falling back to `main` and `master` by convention when neither exists. To remove one anyway, do it with git and then delete the session.

An externally placed `git worktree lock` is not a deletion guard: aoe locks every worktree it creates and unlocks before each intentional remove or move, so it unlocks yours too.

## Warnings during create

Two kinds of non-fatal failure surface through the same channel instead of aborting the session: a `⚠` line on stderr for `aoe add`, a **Worktree warnings** dialog in the TUI, and a toast plus `warnings: string[]` on the `POST /api/sessions` response for the web.

**Post-checkout hooks.** Some repos install pre-commit hooks at the `post-checkout` stage (`uv-sync`, `npm install`, LFS smudge) that fire when `git worktree add` checks out the branch. If one fails, the worktree and its `.git` pointer already exist and are usable. Usually the hook needs network access or credentials the new worktree does not have yet: re-run it by hand once the environment is set up, or set `core.hooksPath` per checkout.

**Fetch failures.** aoe runs `git fetch <remote> <branch>` before checking out, and network errors, missing remotes, SSH key problems, and 10s timeouts surface as `git fetch <remote> <branch> failed for <repo>: <stderr>`. The session is still created, branching off whatever local ref exists, which may be stale. A multi-repo session emits one warning per failing repo.
